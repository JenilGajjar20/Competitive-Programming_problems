## Problem Statement 
Given an integer array nums, return an integer array counts where counts[i] is the number of smaller elements to the right of nums[i].

## Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,2,6,1]
Output: [2,1,1,0]
Explanation:
To the right of 5 there are 2 smaller elements (2 and 1).
To the right of 2 there is only 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 6 there is 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 1 there is 0 smaller element.

## Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1]
Output: [0]

## Example 3:

Input: nums = [-1,-1]
Output: [0,0]

## Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
