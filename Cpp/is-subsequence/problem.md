## Is Subsequence

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `s` is a **_subsequence_** of `t`, or `false` otherwise.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

#### Example 1:

- Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
- Output: true

#### Example 2:

- Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
- Output: false

#### Constraints:

- `0 <= s.length <= 100`
- `0 <= t.length <= 104`
- `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.
