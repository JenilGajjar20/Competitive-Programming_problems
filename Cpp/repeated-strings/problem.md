## Repeated Strings

There is a string, `s`, of lowercase English letters that is repeated infinitely many times. Given an integer, `n`, find and print the number of letter a's in the first `n` letters of the infinite string.

#### Example

```
s = 'abcac'
n = 10
```

The substring we consider is `abcacabcac`, the first `10` characters of the infinite string. There are `4` occurrences of **a** in the substring.

#### Function Description

repeatedString has the following parameter(s):

- `s`: a string to repeat
- `n`: the number of characters to consider

#### Returns

- `int`: the frequency of a in the substring

#### Input Format

- The first line contains a single string, `s`.
- The second line contains an integer, `n`.

#### Constraints

- `1 <= |s| <= 100`
- `1 <= n <= 10^12`
- For `25%` of the test cases, `n <= 10^6`.
