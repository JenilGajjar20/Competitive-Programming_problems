You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST), where the values of exactly two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake. Recover the tree without changing its structure.
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,3,null,null,2]
Output: [3,1,null,null,2]
Explanation: 3 cannot be a left child of 1 because 3 > 1. Swapping 1 and 3 makes the BST valid.

Example 2:

Input: root = [3,1,4,null,null,2]
Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]
Explanation: 2 cannot be in the right subtree of 3 because 2 < 3. Swapping 2 and 3 makes the BST valid.

Constraints:

The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 1000].
-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1

Follow up: A solution using O(n) space is pretty straight-forward. Could you devise a constant O(1) space solution?
