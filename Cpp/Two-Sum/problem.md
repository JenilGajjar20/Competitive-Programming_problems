Problem Description:

You are given an array of integers nums and an integer target. Your task is to find two numbers in the array that add up to the given target.

Write a function twoSum(nums, target) that returns the indices of the two numbers in the array that add up to the target.

Input:

An array nums of integers (2 <= |nums| <= 10^5), where |nums| represents the number of elements in the array.
An integer target (-10^9 <= target <= 10^9).
Output:

A vector of two integers representing the indices of the two numbers in the array that add up to the target.
Constraints:

Each input has exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
The order of the elements in the output does not matter.
Example:

Input:
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9

Output:
[0, 1]

Explanation:

In the given array [2, 7, 11, 15], the numbers at indices 0 and 1 (2 and 7) add up to the target 9. Therefore, the output is [0, 1].
