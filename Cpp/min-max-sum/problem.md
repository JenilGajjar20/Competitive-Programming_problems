## MinMaxSum

Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

#### Example

- arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

- The minimum sum is _1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16_ and the maximum sum is _3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 24_.
- The function prints:

```
16 24
```

#### Function Description

The function has the following parameter(s):

- **arr**: an array of _5_ integers

#### Print

- Print two space-separated integers on one line: the minimum sum and the maximum sum of _4_ of _5_ elements.

#### Input Format

- A single line of five space-separated integers.

#### Constraints

- 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9

#### Output Format

- Print two space-separated long integers denoting the respective minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. (The output can be greater than a 32 bit integer.)
