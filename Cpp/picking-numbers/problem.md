## Picking Numbers

Given an array of integers, find the longest subarray where the absolute difference between any two elements is less than or equal to `1`.

#### Example

`a = [1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5]`

There are two sub-arrays meeting the criterion: `[1, 1, 2, 2]` and `[4, 4, 5, 5, 5]`. The maximum length sub-array has `5` elements.

#### Function Description

pickingNumbers has the following parameter(s):

- `int a[n]`: an array of integers

#### Returns

- `int`: the length of the longest sub-array that meets the criterion

#### Input Format

- The first line contains a single integer `n`, the size of the array `a`.
- The second line contains `n` space-separated integers, each an `a[i]`.

#### Constraints

- `2 <= n <= 100`.
- `0 < a[i] < 100`.
- The answer will be `>= 2`.
