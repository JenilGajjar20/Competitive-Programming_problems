## Length of Last Word

Given a string `s` consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

#### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 104`
- `s` consists of only English letters and spaces `' '`.
- There will be at least one word in `s`.
