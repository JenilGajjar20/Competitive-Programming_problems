# Maximum Product Subarray

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums`, your task is to find a subarray that has the largest product, and return that product. A subarray is defined as a contiguous part of an array.

The test cases are generated such that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

## Objective

Return the maximum product of any subarray within the given integer array `nums`.

---

### Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 20,000`
- `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`
- The product of any subarray of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

### Examples

**Input 1:**

```plaintext
nums = [2, 3, -2, 4]
```

**Output 1:**

```plaintext
6
```

**Input 2:**

```plaintext
nums = [-2,0,-1]
```

**Output 2:**

```plaintext
0
```
