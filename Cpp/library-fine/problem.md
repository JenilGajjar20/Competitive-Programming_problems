## Library Fine

Your local library needs your help! Given the expected and actual return dates for a library book, create a program that calculates the fine (if any). The fee structure is as follows:

1. If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged (i.e.: `fine = 0`).
2. If the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the same calendar month and year as the expected return date, `fine = 15 Hackos x (the number of days late)`.
3. If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the same calendar year as the expected return date, the `fine = 500 Hackos x (the number of months late)`.
4. If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine of `10000 Hackos`.

Charges are based only on the least precise measure of lateness. For example, whether a book is due January 1, 2017 or December 31, 2017, if it is returned January 1, 2018, that is a year late and the fine would be `10,000 Hackos`.

#### Example

```
d1, m1, y1 = 14, 7, 2018
d2, m2, y2 = 9, 7, 2018
```

The first values are the return date and the second are the due date. The years are the same and the months are the same. The book is `14 - 9 = 5` days late. Return `9 * 5 = 135`.

#### Function Description

libraryFine has the following parameter(s):

- `d1, m1, y1`: returned date day, month and year, each an integer
- `d2, m2, y2`: due date day, month and year, each an integer

#### Returns

- `int`: the amount of the fine or `0` if there is none

#### Input Format

- The first line contains `3` space-separated integers, `d1, m1, y1`, denoting the respective `day`, `month`, and `year` on which the book was returned.
- The second line contains `3` space-separated integers, `d2, m2, y2`, denoting the respective `day`, `month`, and `year` on which the book was due to be returned.

#### Constraints

- `1 <= d1, d2 <= 31`
- `1 <= m1, m2 <= 12`
- `1 <= y1, y2 <= 3000`
- It is guaranteed that the dates will be valid Gregorian calender dates.
