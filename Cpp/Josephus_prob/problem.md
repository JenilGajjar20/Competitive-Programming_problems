# Josephus Problem

The **Josephus Problem** is a theoretical problem related to a certain elimination game. It can be described as follows:

## Problem Description

**N people are standing in a circle.** Starting with the first person, a count is made up to K. The K-th person is eliminated from the circle, and the process is repeated with the next person in the circle. This continues until only one person remains, who is considered to be in the "safe position." 

The objective is to find the safe position.

### Example
For `n = 5` (5 people) and `k = 2` (every second person is eliminated):
- The order of elimination will be: 2, 4, 1, 5.
- The last remaining person (safe position) is 3.
