## Breaking the records

Maria plays college basketball and wants to go pro. Each season she maintains a record of her play. She tabulates the number of times she breaks her season record for most points and least points in a game. Points scored in the first game establish her record for the season, and she begins counting from there.

#### Example

`scores = [12, 24, 10, 24]`

Scores are in the same order as the games played. She tabulates her results as follows:

                                     Count
    Game  Score  Minimum  Maximum   Min Max
     0      12     12       12       0   0
     1      24     12       24       0   1
     2      10     10       24       1   1
     3      24     10       24       1   1

Given the scores for a season, determine the number of times Maria breaks her records for most and least points scored during the season.

#### Function Description

The function has the following parameter(s):

- `int scores[n]`: points scored per game

#### Returns

- `int[2]`: An array with the numbers of times she broke her records. Index `0` is for breaking most points records, and index `1` is for breaking least points records.

#### Input Format

- The first line contains an integer `n`, the number of games.
- The second line contains `n` space-separated integers describing the respective values of `score(0)`, `score(1)`, ... , `score(n-1)`.

#### Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 1000`
- `0 <= scores[i] <= 10^8`
