As you know Bob likes to destroy the buildings.<br>
There are N buildings in a city, ith building has ai floors.<br>
Bob can do the following operation.<br>
Choose a building, and destroy its uppermost floor with cost h. Where h is building's height before removing the floor<br>
You can do this operation any number of times but total cost should be less than or equal to K<br>
Since you don't like tall buildings you want to decrease their heights.<br>
You have to minimise the maximum height of buildings and report this height (height of tallest among them after operations).<br>

(Use long long data type instead of int to avoid overflow errors)<br>
