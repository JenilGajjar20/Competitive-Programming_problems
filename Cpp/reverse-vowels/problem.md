# Reverse Vowels of a String

Given a string `s`, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it.

The vowels are `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, and `'u'`, and they can appear in both lower and upper cases, more than once.

#### Example 1:

- Output: "holle"

#### Example 2:

- Input: s = "leetcode"
- Output: "leotcede"

#### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 3 x 10^5`
- `s` consist of **printable ASCII** characters.
