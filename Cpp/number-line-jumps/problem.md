## Number Line Jumps

You are choreographing a circus show with various animals. For one act, you are given two kangaroos on a number line ready to jump in the positive direction (i.e, toward positive infinity).

- The first kangaroo starts at location `x1` and moves at a rate of `v1` meters per jump.
- The second kangaroo starts at location `x2` and moves at a rate of `v2` meters per jump.

You have to figure out a way to get both kangaroos at the same location at the same time as part of the show. If it is possible, return **YES**, otherwise return **NO**.

#### Example

```
x1 = 2
v1 = 1
x2 = 1
v2 = 2
```

After one jump, they are both at `x = 3`, (`x1 + v1 = 2 + 1`, `x2 + v2 = 1 + 2`), so the answer is **YES**.

#### Function Description

The function has the following parameter(s):

- `int x1, int v1`: starting position and jump distance for kangaroo 1
- `int x2, int v2`: starting position and jump distance for kangaroo 2

#### Returns

- string: either **YES** or **NO**

#### Input Format

- A single line of four space-separated integers denoting the respective values of `x1`, `v1`, `x2` and `v2`.

#### Constraints

- 0 <= x1 < x2 <= 1000
- 1 <= v1 <= 10000
- 1 <= v2 <= 10000
