Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
-2^31 <= Node.val <= 2^31 - 1
