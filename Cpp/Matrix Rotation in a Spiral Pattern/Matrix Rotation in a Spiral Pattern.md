Challenge: Matrix Rotation in a Spiral Pattern

Implement a C++ function that rotates a given matrix in a spiral pattern, starting from the top-left corner and spiraling towards the center.

Input:
A 2D matrix represented by a vector of vectors, where each inner vector represents a row in the matrix.

Output:
Modify the input matrix in-place to represent the rotated matrix in a spiral pattern.

This challenge requires you to rotate a matrix in a spiral pattern, which involves carefully swapping elements in the matrix according to the specified pattern. The code provided demonstrates how to implement this functionality.
