# Problem Statement
Given 'n' non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

# Example 1
    Input
    -----
    height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]

    Output
    ------
    6

    Explanation: The maximum water being trapped in this case is between indices 3 and 7

# Example 2
    Input
    -----
    height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]

    Output
    ------
    9

    Explanation: The maximum water being trapped in this case is between indices 0 and 5

# Constraints
    1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
    n == height.length
    0 <= height[i] <= 10^5
