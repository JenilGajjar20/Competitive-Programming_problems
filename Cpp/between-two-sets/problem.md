## Between two sets

There will be two arrays of integers. Determine all integers that satisfy the following two conditions:

- The elements of the first array are all factors of the integer being considered
- The integer being considered is a factor of all elements of the second array

These numbers are referred to as being between the two arrays. Determine how many such numbers exist.

#### Example

```
a = [2, 6]
b = [24, 36]
```

There are two numbers between the arrays: `6` and `12`.

`6 % 2 = 0`, `6 % 6 = 0`, `24 % 6 = 0` and `36 % 6 = 0` for the first value.
`12 % 2 = 0`, `12 % 6 = 0`, `24 % 12 = 0` and `36 % 12 = 0` for the second value. Return `2`.

#### Function Description

getTotalX function should return the number of integers that are between the sets.

getTotalX has the following parameter(s):

- `int a[n]`: an array of integers
- `int b[m]`: an array of integers

#### Returns

- `int`: the number of integers that are between the sets

#### Input Format

- The first line contains two space-separated integers, `n` and `m`, the number of elements in arrays `a` and `b`.
- The second line contains `n` distinct space-separated integers `a[i]` where `0 <= i < n`.
- The third line contains `m` distinct space-separated integers `b[j]` where `0 <= j < m`.

#### Constraints

- `1 <= n,m <= 10`
- `1 <= a[i] <= 100`
- `1 <= b[j] <= 100`
