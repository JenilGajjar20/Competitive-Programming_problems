## Between Two Sets

There will be two arrays of integers. Determine all integers that satisfy the following two conditions:

1. The elements of the first array are all factors of the integer being considered
2. The integer being considered is a factor of all elements of the second array

These numbers are referred to as being between the two arrays. Determine how many such numbers exist.

#### Example

```
a = [2, 6]
b = [24, 36]
```
