## Sqrt(x)

Given a non-negative integer `x`, return the square root of `x` rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

For example, do not use `pow(x, 0.5)` in **c++** or `x ** 0.5` in **python**.

#### Constraints:

- `0 <= x <= 231 - 1`
