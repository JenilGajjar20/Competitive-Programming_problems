## Search a 2D Matrix - ii

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value `target` in an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix`. This matrix has the following properties:

- Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
- Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

#### Constraints:

- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= n, m <= 300`
- `-10^9 <= matrix[i][j] <= 10^9`
- All the integers in each row are **sorted** in ascending order.
- All the integers in each column are **sorted** in ascending order.
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`
