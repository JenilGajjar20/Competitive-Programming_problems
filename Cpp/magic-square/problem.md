## Forming a Magic Square

We define a magic square to be an `n x n` matrix of distinct positive integers from `1` to `n^2` where the sum of any row, column, or diagonal of length `n` is always equal to the same number: the magic constant.

You will be given a `3 x 3` matrix `s` of integers in the inclusive range `[1, 9]`. We can convert any digit `a` to any other digit `b` in the range `[1, 9]` at cost of `|a - b|`. Given `s`, convert it into a magic square at minimal cost. Print this cost on a new line.

**Note**: The resulting magic square must contain distinct integers in the inclusive range `[1, 9]`.

#### Example

$s = [[5, 3, 4], [1, 5, 8], [6, 4, 2]]

The matrix looks like this:

```
5 3 4
1 5 8
6 4 2
```

We can convert it to the following magic square:

```
8 3 4
1 5 9
6 7 2
```

This took three replacements at a cost of **`|5 - 8| + |8 - 9| + |4 - 7| = 7`**.

#### Function Description

formingMagicSquare has the following parameter(s):

- `int s[3][3]`: a `3 x 3` array of integers

#### Returns

- `int`: the minimal total cost of converting the input square to a magic square

#### Input Format

Each of the `3` lines contains three space-separated integers of row `s[i]`.

#### Constraints

- `s[i][j] belongs to [1, 9]`
