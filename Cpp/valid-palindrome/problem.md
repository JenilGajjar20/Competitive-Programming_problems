## Valid Palindrome

A phrase is a **palindrome** if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string `s`, return `true` if it is a **_palindrome_**, or `false` otherwise.

#### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 2 * 105`
- `s` consists only of printable ASCII characters.
