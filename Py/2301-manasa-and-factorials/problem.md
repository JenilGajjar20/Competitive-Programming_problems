# [Manasa and Factorials](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/manasa-and-factorials/problem)
Manasa was sulking her way through a boring class when suddenly her teacher singled her out and asked her a question. He gave her a number n and Manasa has to come up with the smallest number m which contains atleast n number of zeros at the end of m!. Help Manasa come out of the sticky situation.

### Input Format
The first line contains an integer T i.e. the number of Test cases.
Next T lines will contain an integer n.

### Output Format
Print smallest such number m.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1016

### Sample Input
```
3
1
2
3
```

### Sample Output
```
5
10
15
```

### Explanation

As 4! = 24 and 5! = 120, so minimum value of m will be 5.

As 9! = 362880 and 10! = 3628800, so minimum value of m will be 10.

As 14! = 87178291200 and 15! = 1307674368000, so minimum value of m will be 15.
